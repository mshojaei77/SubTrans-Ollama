## What the Settings Mean (Made Simple)

- **Ollama Model**: Which AI to use for translation. The default option is best for most users.
- **Context Window Size**: How many surrounding subtitles the AI looks at. Larger number = better translations but slower.
- **Batch Size**: How many subtitles to translate at once. Larger number = faster but uses more computer power.
- **Delay Between Batches**: How long to wait between groups of translations. Helps prevent your computer from getting too hot.

## Troubleshooting: Common Problems and Solutions

### "I can't install Python"
- Make sure you have administrator access on your computer.
- Try downloading Python from the Microsoft Store if you're on Windows 10 or 11.

### "Ollama isn't working"
- Make sure Ollama is running (check for its icon in your system tray).
- Restart your computer and try again.
- For Mac users: You might need to right-click the app and select "Open" the first time.
- ensure no proxy is running on your computer in 127.0.0.1:11434 (this is the default port for ollama)

### "I see errors when running the app"
- Make sure you installed all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Try restarting Ollama.
- Check that you're using Python 3.12 or newer: type `python --version` in your terminal.

### "The translations aren't good"
- Try increasing the "Context Window Size" to 5 or higher.
- Make sure you're using the recommended model (mshojaei77/gemma3persian).

### "The translation is very slow, or my computer is overheating / using too much CPU"
- Reduce the "Batch Size". A smaller batch size uses less processing power at once.
- Increase the "Delay Between Batches". This gives your computer more time to cool down between processing chunks of subtitles.
- Consider using a lighter model like gemma3:1b instead of gemma3persian for faster processing, though translations may be less accurate.
- If you have a dedicated GPU, ensure Ollama is configured to use it. Consult the Ollama documentation for GPU configuration.
- Close other applications that may be using significant CPU or GPU resources.
