[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:04,588
Morty, you got to come on.

3
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:06,128
You got to come with me.

4
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:07,046
What's going on?

5
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,049
I got a surprise for you, Morty.

6
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:08,918
It's the middle of the night.

7
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,716
I got a surprise for you.

8
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:13,590
Ow! You're tugging me too hard.

9
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,281
I got a surprise for you, Morty.

10
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,185
What do you… [BURPS] What do you

11
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,180
think of this flying vehicle, Morty?

12
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,856
I built it out of stuff I
found in the garage.

13
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,316
Yeah, Rick, it's… it's great.

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,481
Is this the surprise?

15
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,649
Morty, I had to… I had to do…

16
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,318
I had to… I had to…

17
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:30,322
I had to make a bomb, Morty.

18
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:31,323
I had to create a bomb.

19
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:32,317
What?! A bomb?!

20
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:33,658
We're gonna drop it down there…
